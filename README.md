## Week 7: Basic pointer exercises ##

### Exercise 1 ###

This project contains several failing tests.

Your task is to follow the instructions in `exercise.hpp` and modify the code so
that all the tests pass.

### Exercise 2 ###

Exercise 2 is all about complicated pointer types.
Your task is to add member variables to the struct `example2` in `exercise2.hpp`,
so that all of the exercise2 tests pass.


**Have fun!**

I like to edit files :)
